This is an application with four screens in NavigationDraw.

Application starts with a splash screen.

The first is a screen with custom RecyclerView.

The second is a screen with an image from a gallery or camera. Image can resize and move.

The third screen is a custom recyclerview with downloaded and parsed json.

The fourth is the screen with the map.

You can also change the language in the application. Implemented splash screen. Used Runtime permission. For the network request, the libraries used are Retrofit2, okHttp3, rxJava2.

UPD:
Now for images using PhotoView and Glide.
